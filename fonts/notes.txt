use the command `mkfontdir` in the directory where the font files are placed (in .gz format).
then,
xset fp+ /full/path/to/font/directory   
xset -q (for a quick check of the directory)
xset fp rehash (tell X it has the new font)

xfd -fn <font name> (to see all of the characters)
xlsfonts | grep <font name> (to make sure it is there)
